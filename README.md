Fake News Detection Tool
Project Overview
The Fake News Detection Tool is a machine learning-based web application designed to identify whether a given news article is real or fake. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify news articles into two categories: real and fake.

The application uses a trained model that processes the text of a news article and predicts its authenticity. The model is built using popular libraries such as Scikit-learn and NLTK, and it is deployed as a web application using Flask (or Django) for users to interact with.

Features
User Interface: A simple, intuitive frontend that allows users to input news articles and get predictions on whether the article is real or fake.
Machine Learning Model: The project uses Logistic Regression or Random Forest classifiers to predict the authenticity of news articles based on their content.
Web Deployment: A user-friendly web interface where users can paste or type a news article and get instant feedback.
Data Processing: The tool uses various text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal to clean and prepare the data for training.
Technologies Used
Backend:
Python
Flask or Django (for web app deployment)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning model)
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit for text processing)
Pickle (for saving and loading the trained model)
Frontend:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Bootstrap (for modern, responsive design)
jQuery (for dynamic interaction)
Machine Learning:
Logistic Regression / Random Forest
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency for feature extraction)
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Git (for version control)
A web browser
Installation
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
cd fake-news-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application: Run the Flask (or Django) server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the server locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or the corresponding port if you're using Django).

Open the Web Application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or the specified port) to interact with the Fake News Detection Tool.
